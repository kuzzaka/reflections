What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I guess it includes the directory to the git structure

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

In the contrary with the working directory, the staging area contains only the files that you've added with 'git add'.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can use the ‘git status’ command to reassure that I commit the files  I need

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

With branch I can try out some new feature without changing the original files. I can also make a different version of an app (on another language for example or another difficulty level if it is a game app).
