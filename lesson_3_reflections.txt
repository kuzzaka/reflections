When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when I want to engage someone to development.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

maybe because I always have to manually set the exact branch to share

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

In situation where there are some developers working on the project together it is much easier to merge their branches using fast-forward merge too. In that case you’ll only have to merge manually the latest commits made by different people
