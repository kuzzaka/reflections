When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when I want to engage someone to development.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

maybe because I always have to manually set the exact branch to share

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

In situation where there are some developers working on the project together it is much easier to merge their branches using fast-forward merge too. In that case youâ€™ll only have to merge manually the latest commits made by different people

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork is a special command that clones somebody's repository to your account on github for you to edit the code there. Clone is a copy of directory with commit history. And branches are clones of the master repository usually used to try a new feature or add experimental functions without changing the master branch i.e. code for production
